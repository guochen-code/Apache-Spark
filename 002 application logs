using Log4J
(1) create a Log4J configuration file (log4j.properties)
(2) configure Spark JVM to pickup the Log4J configuration file
(3) create a Python Class to get Spark's Log4J instance and use it

# which configuration is used to pass values to Spark driver JVM?
spark.driver.extraJavaOptions

# you can inform spark that log4j.properties file is present in the current directory using:
-Dlogj.configuration=file:log4j.properties

# what is the use of spark.yarn.app.container.log.dir variable?
- this variable is used by YARN log aggregator to find your application log files
- log4j file appender will create log files in this directory

# you can define spark.extraJavaOptions in the following file:
SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf
